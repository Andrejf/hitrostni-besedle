# Speed Wordle

Real time Wordle.

Say goodbye to going on [wordhippo.com](https://www.wordhippo.com/) to search for five-letter words that start with a Z and have an X somewhere in the middle. Just type whatever you want and the game will provide instant feedback.

Also, there is a timer.

Keyboard controls:
  + Letter keys: Enters the associated letter into the text box.
  + ENTER: Clears the text box.
  + BACKSPACE: Deletes the most recently entered letter.
  + The buttons on the screen don't do anything.

The word bank comes from a text file I downloaded from *The New York Times* WordleBot page containing a list of all possible answers. I can't find it anymore so they might have removed it.

Oh, and the answer was zaxes, if you were wondering.
